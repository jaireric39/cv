          Hi, I'm Eric. I recently graduated from San Jose State University, with a Bachelors in Computer Science.
          <br>
          I’ve taught myself how to code in high school and continued to code and learn a number of languages at SJSU. Work-wise, in summer 2020, I originally landed an internship at Workday as an Application Developer, but sadly due to covid, it was
          cancelled. Instead, I spent a short while helping a family friends’ startup.
